# Welcome! Find out more about me and my projects

I have my roots in biology, added a sprinkle of IT, and now my heart is firmly in marketing & communication, and in event organisation. I'm looking for a challenging and fun job in Oulu, preferably one that includes people from many different backgrounds, and other learning opportunities!
